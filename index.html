    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated second-year college student with a solid foundation in C++ 
        and Java programming languages, I am eager to apply my technical skills 
        in a professional setting. My coursework has equipped me with a strong understanding 
        of software development principles, and I am excited to leverage this knowledge to 
        contribute to real-world projects. While my experience in a professional workspace 
        is currently limited, I am committed to learning and adapting quickly, 
        bringing a fresh perspective and enthusiasm to collaborative teams. 
        I am seeking opportunities to further develop my expertise, contribute meaningfully 
        to projects,and gain valuable hands-on experience in the field of software development.</p>
